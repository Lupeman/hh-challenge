# Hardhat Challenge

## Overview

### Notes:
- Attached is a Photoshop file that represents the states of a webpage element on one of our real projects
- Please build this element using HTML and CSS
- In the PSD file, the left side is normal state
- The right side is the hover state of the same element
- It's preferable if the transition is animated
- We expect this will take about an hour to complete.
- There is no trick! We are just looking for nice, clean and simple code. :)

### For extra points:
- The date should be dynamically populated with today's date (at runtime using Javascript)

### Submission:
- You can submit the answer via a github / bitbucket repository or any other means that let's us check the CSS, HTML and Javascript. Codepen, Zip file, etc.
- Feel free to use any tools required, including a CSS pre-processor.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sass, Gulp, Git.
